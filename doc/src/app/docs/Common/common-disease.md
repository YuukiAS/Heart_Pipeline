title: Common Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD)
---

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a collective term designating all types of affliction affecting the blood circulatory system, including the heart and vasculature, which, respectively, displaces and conveys the blood. Over the last decade, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the single largest cause of death worldwide. In 2004, CVD caused an estimated 17 million deaths and led to 151 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost—about 30% of all deaths and 14% of all DALYs lost that year. Like many high-income countries during the last century, low- and middle-income countries are seeing an alarming increase in the rates of CVD, and this change is accelerating. In 2001, 75% of global deaths and 82% of total DALYs lost caused by coronary heart disease (CHD) occurred in low- and middle-income countries.

The sections below will detail the most common cardiovascular diseases, the specific references will be put at the end of each section while the general ones will be provided at the end of the document.

## Atrial Fibrillation 心房颤动 (AF)

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by disorganized atrial electrical activation and uncoordinated atrial contraction. The surface electrocardiogram characteristically demonstrates rapid fibrillatory waves with changing morphology and rate and a ventricular rhythm that is irregularly irregular.

> In this ECG: Firstly, no consistent P waves are observed. Instead, the baseline shows rapid and irregular "fibrillatory waves" (f waves). Secondly, The normal flat baseline is replaced by irregular fluctuations, which are the "fibrillatory waves" seen during atrial fibrillation. These appear as rapid and small undulations. Lastly, the intervals between QRS complexes (R-R intervals) are completely irregular in this ECG.

## (Chronic) Heart Failure 心力衰竭 (HF)

Chronic heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that has multiple causes and etiologies. The core lesion involves structural and functional changes in the heart and peripheral vasculature that lead to impaired systolic and diastolic function. The resultant clinical manifestations are variable, but the most common symptoms include exertional dypsnea, orthopnea, and nocturnal dypsnea. Other common signs and symptoms include edema, fatigue, and chest congestion. HF can be classified into three groups based on the percentage of the ejection fraction (EF): heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF), heart failure with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

### Coronary Atherosclerosis 冠状动脉粥样硬化

The most common and important vascular disease that affects both the brain and the heart is atherosclerosis. Extra- and intracranial arterial atherosclerosis is common in patients with coronary artery disease.

### Myocardial Infarction 心肌梗死 (MI)

Myocardial Infarction is a critical myocardial function-related disease, arising when blood flow to a part of the myocardium is obstructed, typically by a clot in the coronary arteries. This blockage can cause damage or death to the affected myocardial area, leading to chest pain, shortness of breath, and potentially severe complications.

The classification of different types of myocardial infarction is shown in the following table:

## Hypertension 高血压

## Pulmonary and Thrombotic Diseases  肺部及血栓性疾病

## Valvular Heart Diseases 瓣膜性心脏病

### Aortic Stenosis 主动脉瓣狭窄

Aortic stenosis is a condition marked by the narrowing of the aortic valve, impeding blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. Common in adults due to valve calcification or age-related degeneration, it can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and fainting.

### Aortic Regurgitation 主动脉反流 (AR)

### Mitral Stenosis 二尖瓣狭窄 (MS)

### Mitral Regurgitation 二尖瓣反流 (MR)

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is characterized by an abnormal reversed blood flow from the left ventricle (LV) to the left atrium (LA) due to abnormalities in the mitral apparatus.

Prolapse of the mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole is now the most common cause of primary MR; left ventricular dysfunction is the most common cause of secondary or functional MR. Additional causes include rheumatic carditis, endocarditis, mitral annular calcification, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, trauma, connective tissue disorders, anorectic agents, and congenital deformities. The competence of the mitral valve depends on the normal structure and function of every part of the mitral apparatus—that is, the leaflets, chordae tendineae, annulus, left atrium, papillary muscles, and LV myocardium surrounding the papillary muscles.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) often develops in patients with heart failure despite the presence of a normal mitral valve. In heart failure, the presence of functional MR is frequently attributed to 1 of 3 factors: LV enlargement, dilation of the mitral annulus or dysfunction of the papillary muscles.

The classification of the cardiomyopathies is shown in the following table:

![Classification of the Cardiomyopathies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuukiAS/ImageHost/main/heart/20241230193208757.png)

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy 扩张性心肌病 (DCM) 

The primary and secondary dilated cardiomyopathies are the most common causes of chronic heart failure.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 肥厚性心肌病 (HCM) 

Hypertrophic is another form with abnormal and often asymmetric myocardial thickening, preserved left ventricular function, phenotypic heterogeneity, and incomplete penetrance. This autosomal dominant inherited disease can be caused by mutations of genes (>50 genes, mainly those encoding sarcomeric constituents).

### Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy 致心律失常性心肌病

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is mainly caused by mutations in genes encoding desmosomal elements. It is characterized by progressive fibroadipose replacement of the myocardium, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells have a lower expression of plakophilin, contain more lipid droplets, and differentiate into adipocytes, contributing to the adipogenic substitution in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

### Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease  糖尿病与心血管疾病

### Rheumatic Diseases and the Cardiovascular System  风湿性疾病与心血管系统

Rheumatic heart disease refers to the damage of the myocardium and cardiac valves caused by streptococci bacteria. This is an inflammatory disease that can affect many connective tissues, especially in the heart, joints, skin, or brain. The heart valves can be inflamed and become scarred over time. This can result in narrowing or leaking of the heart valve. It is most frequently detected in low-income countries.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart malformation and
one of the first complex lesions to be successfully repaired; it occurs in 7% to 10%
of children with CHD. The 4 characteristic findings are (1) malaligned VSD, (2) RV
outflow and/or pulmonary valve/artery stenosis or atresia, (3) dextroposed overriding
aorta, and (4) RV hypertrophy.
