title: Evaluation of Ventricular Volume
---


## Description of Modality

A complete short axis (SA) stack of balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) cines covering the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). A short-axis image stack typically consists of 10 image slices. Each cardiac cycle consists of 50 time frames.

To acquire a short axis view, center perpendicular to the septum on the four-chamber long axis view (HLA). The resultant image will demonstrate the LV and RV in a nice circular shape.

*(M.D et al., 2008)*

The high resolution offered by CMR, have permitted unparalleled ability to accurately delineate myocardium and blood pools. The CMR now becomes the "gold standard" for LV/RV functional assessment because (M.D et al., 2008):

1. High resolution
2. High endocardial and epicardial intrinsic contrast
3. Absence of foreshortening, due to exact placement of anatomy by prescription
4. Near absence of any user-dependence limitation
5. Reproducibility and accuracy to within 5 mL of volume
6. Not dependent on any geometric assumptions
7. Ability to perform three-dimensional (3D) imaging for exact measurements quickly (no absolute need for 2D anymore)
8. Volume-time measurements
9. Regional LV quantification; visually and/or quantitatively
10. Moderate to high temporal resolution

## Features: Definition, How to Derive, and Clinical Relevance


### Volume

The volumes are calculated by summing up the number of voxels belonging to the corresponding label class in the segmentation, multiplied by the volume per voxel as in (Bai et al., 2018). There are alternative algorithms to calculate the volume, each assuming different geometric model for the ventricle such as Simpson's rule, which consider the ventricle as the sum of a cylinder (from the base to the mitral valve), a truncated cone and another cone attributed to the cardiac apex, each assuming to be of equal height. (Folland et al., 1979).

### Stroke Volume

The stroke volume (SV) is defined as the chamber volume ejected in systole, and can be simply calculated as the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume $LVSV=LVEDV-LVESV$. 

### Cardiac Output and Cardiac Index

The cardiac output is the product of the stroke volume and the heart rate. 

### Ejection Fraction

The ejection fraction, especially the left ventricular ejection faction (LVEF), is simplest and the most well-accepted expression of global LV systolic function. EF is defined as the ratio between stroke volume and end-diastolic volume $LVEF=\frac{(LVEDV-LVESV)}{LVEDV}=\frac{LVSV}{LVEDV}$, essentially being a measurement of endocardial strain. EF is more useful marker than the stroke volume, since it accounts for the Frank-Starling relationship, which states that the stroke volume increases in response to an increase in end-diastolic volume (Kirkpatrick et al., 1976).


Marker of gross LV dysfunction

**LVEF** is a powerful predictor of cardiac mortality. In clinical practice, LVEF has become the primary criterion used for defibrillator placement. 

+ It now occupies a central position in guidelines for the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device (ICD) when recommended for primary prevention of LV sudden cardiac death.
+ Higher LVEFs were also associated with a linear decrease in modality up to an LVEF of 45% among heart failure patients. However, increases above 45% were not associated with further reductions in mortality. 
+ Additionally, it is an important parameter to monitor LV function in the course of cardiotoxic chemotherapy (chemotherapy drugs that can cause damage to the heart). If during chemotherapy, LVEF decreases > 10% from baseline to a final LVEF below 53%, patients must be referred to the cardio-oncology unit to consider heart failure therapy. 
+ Moreover, in patients with valvular diseases, LVEF is also used as one of the criteria to determine management. Aortic valve replacement is recommended for asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) or chronic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and LVEF < 50%. Mitral valve surgery is considered for asymptomatic patients with LVEF <= 60% (Kosaraju et al., 2024).

An ejection fraction of <35% is important in decision-making regarding device therapy, either with implantable defibrillators or cardiac resynchronisation therapy. (ACC/AHA/NASPE 2002 Guideline Update for Implantation of Cardiac Pacemakers and Antiarrhythmia Devices, n.d.)

However, LVEF still has a number of important limitations and may provide suboptimal evaluation. The ejection fraction is load-dependent, meaning that it cannot be interpreted as a reflection of contractility in the absence of knowledge about afterload and preload. Instead, the performance of a pressure-volume loop may better facilitate the understanding of contractility (Marwick, 2013). In addition, the ejection fraction is influenced by heart rate. The increased stroke volume associated with bradycardia may lead to overestimation of the true ejection fraction, and conversely in tachycardia, the reduced stroke volume may lead to underestimation of the actual function (Marwick, 2013).

### Dimensions

Both longitudinal and transverse diameters can be derived for the left ventricle.

```py
evaluate_ventricular_length_sax()
evaluate_ventricular_length_lax()
```

The LV mass is calculated by multiplying the LV myocardial volume with the density of 1.05g/mL (Bai et al., 2018).


### Sphericity Index

The sphericity index is calculated at end-systole and end-diastole as the volume of the left ventricle divided by the volume of a sphere whose diameter is equal to the longitudinal diameter (major axis of the ventricle). As this ratio increases, the shape of the left ventricle approaches that of a sphere (Kono et al., 1991).

For patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the more spherical LV chamber is shown by a few studies to be associated with higher end-systolic wall stress, an abnormal distribution of fiber shortening and a poor long-term survival. In patients with heart failure due to either coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy and LVEF <= 30%, a more spherical LV chamber is associated with the presence of functional MR (Kono et al., 1991).
